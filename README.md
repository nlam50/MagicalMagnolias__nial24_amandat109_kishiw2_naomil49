## Description  
Magnolia Gardens is a stimulator type game with a primary focus on growing and maintaining a garden of flowers. As days pass with user discretion, flowers must be watered and receive certain amounts of sunlight depending on the flower species. Events have a chance of occurring when a new day comes to spice up the experience. They may be negative or positive. Minigames will be where resources come from.
